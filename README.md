# Facial-Emotion-Detection
This psychological theory suggests that facial expressions don't just reflect emotionsâ€”they can create or amplify them. For example, if you smile, your brain might actually start to feel happy, even if you weren't before.

When applied to projects like a facial emotion detector, this theory underscores how deeply emotions are connected to expressions. It also shows how AI can bridge psychology and technology to analyze and even influence emotional states!
